## Portfolio
Note: My official name is - Ying Pan, but I go by Adam, hence the name difference on the site.

This portfolio uses bootstrap template that combines all the pages into one clean page. The website describes backgrounds about me, some information about my resume and three showcase projects. 
 

## Design Ideas & Change
The design layout have a clean design that has a landing page that focus visitors's attention to my profile, follow by a showcase of my projects.
I also wanted to be able to integrate some fluidity into my website design which was lacking in my original prototype. The website allows potential visitors to easily navigate around my portfolio and quickly find information about myself and projects I have done and included links for recruiters to contact me.
